# license-reader

Inspired by [`license-checker`](https://github.com/davglass/license-checker) and this nice [post](https://blog.expo.dev/licenses-the-best-part-of-your-app-29e7285b544f) by Evan Bacon I wanted to make my License-Info better. 

As license-checker does only provide a part of the info and I want to use it universally in all my apps with all display information included I started to use license-checker as a start with a Python-script on top and then tried to include it in one script for my purpose. 

Usage: 
```
licenses.py --in /myproject/root --out /myproject/root/subfolder/licenses.json
```


It is my first Python-Script so be polite and provide improvements if you like.
